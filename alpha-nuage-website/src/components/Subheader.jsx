                Northeastern University Association of Gaming Enthusiasts
                (NUAGE) is Northeastern’s official tabletop gaming club. We hold Casual Game Night and
                 other events every Friday and Saturday night starting at 7:00PM in Forsyth building room
                 #201. We’ve got tons of board games for everyone to enjoy, so don’t hesitate to come out
                 to meet some new people and learn some new games. Never heard of any of our games? No 
                 problem! We at NUAGE love teaching games almost as much as we love playing them.
                 NUAGE will stimulate students’ minds through puzzle and logic based thought in the form
                 of fun and enriching games. We have no target student demographic and welcome all those 
                 interested in playing a wide variety of games. Our mission is to create a diverse 
                 community of Northeastern Students interested in puzzle and logic based board games. 
                 The goal isn’t to win, but to have fun; although, winning is nice.
